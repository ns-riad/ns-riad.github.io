	abstract = {Abnormal driving of a driver often leads to some undesirable situations. To avoid such circumstances, this paper proposes a driver-adaptive system that can detect abnormality within one’s own driving style. To achieve such a feat, firstly, a soft clustering approach is proposed to determine the driving style in three categories - aggressive, moderate, and protective. Then, it proposes an algorithm to analyze the driving profile and detect the variation of abnormality of the driver. Statistics of different vehicle kinetic characteristics, i.e., velocity, space and time headway, acceleration, jerk factor, etc., are considered for the clustering process. Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) is used to select the important features. Analyzing the results of different clustering algorithms such as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), FCM, and K-means, we used GMM in the proposed system for determining real-time driving style. The actual driving style is determined using the long-term driving history of the subject vehicle. Using GMM’s soft clustering properties, the current deviation is measured by comparing the real-time driving style to the actual style. A learning factor is accommodated to update the actual style in every cycle so that the proposed system can adapt to the driver’s skill-changing state. Real-life driving depends on real-time human decisions. Therefore, we have used the reconstructed NGSIM I-80 real-life traffic data to build and validate the proposed system.},

	abstract = {The state prediction of the preceding vehicle (PV) is essential for anticipatory driving that enables a vehicle to take early steps for efficient driving. Such driving results in energy efficiency and traffic flow improvement but also requires repeated rigorous computations. Here we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based driving scheme (DDS) that is trained to predict the PV and decide the control input of a host vehicle (HV) using two DNN models. We use the Road-Speed Profile (RSP), which provides approximated traffic speeds along the road using information from limited connected vehicles, to predict the future speed of the PV. Next, with the predicted speed of the PV, the control input is instantly determined to drive the HV efficiently. For making the optimal control decisions, the DNN is trained using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that generates the control input of the HV by minimizing a typical objective function reflecting costs related to inefficient driving. In the simulation, it is found that the proposed DDS guides the HV to change acceleration early in the optimized way by predicting the PV, particularly in changing traffic conditions, which results in a significant reduction in fuel consumption of the HV. Most remarkably, the DDS can determine the decision almost in real-time, which removes the necessity of setting a long step in the discrete-time control framework as found in MPC to match with its computation time. The proposed DDS is evaluated in some extreme cases and compared with traditional driving.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection and interpretation of road lane markings (RLM) are essential for maintaining safe and efficient traffic flow. However, conventional computer vision methods encounter significant difficulties in handling occluded images. This research presents an innovative system named Road Lane Markings Detection (RLMD) that employs deep learning techniques to predict RLM from occluded images and provides their corresponding meanings. To address the limitations of existing approaches, a comprehensive dataset of RLM images, covering diverse occlusion scenarios, is created. Several deep learning baseline network architectures are used and trained on this dataset, enabling precise RLM prediction. Moreover, algorithms are devised to extract the meanings associated with various types of RLM, including broken lines, solid lines, and double solid lines in both yellow and white colors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showcasing its potential to enhance road safety and support driver assistance systems with 96.39% using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) layers. By overcoming the challenges posed by occlusions, the proposed system contributes significantly to the field of RLM prediction and its corresponding meanings using deep learning.},

abstract = {Error detection and correction are crucial for data transmission and storage systems, and Traditional Hamming codes (THC) may lead to inefficiencies in storage and transmission overhead. This paper presents a novel approach called Enhanced Hamming Codes (EHC), which aims to reduce redundant bits while maintaining error detection and correction capabilities. The study reviews the existing methods and proposes an enhanced encoding scheme that minimizes redundant bits. The enhanced encoding scheme is a storage-utilized system where a suitable base is extracted from the data. The methodology utilizes optimized error detection algorithms and optimized encoding techniques for efficient resource utilization. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach achieves a successful reduction in redundant bits, leading to enhanced storage usage for overall data transmission. Additionally, the Hamming Code maintains robust error detection and correction capabilities, ensuring reliable data integrity. This research has practical implications in various domains, such as telecommunications, data storage systems, and network protocols. The EHC technique offers a promising solution for reducing redundant bits in error detection and correction codes, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. This research opens avenues for further exploration and optimization of error detection and correction techniques, ultimately leading to more reliable and resource-efficient data transmission and storage systems.},
